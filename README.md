PythonForYear1Geographers
=========================

As an experiment, my first year (Geography BA/BSc) tutees are learning to program in python.

These notes will provide backup material for what we have covered. They can also be used as a 'self learning' resource for other students. 

I encourage any (UCL) students who have difficulties with what we are doing to see me in my office hours or (email me)[http:www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis]
